01 Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone
- Anime 2007 720p [H264-mp4] English

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.209
It shows up now, of all times!?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.550
Geez...


00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.039
Due to the present state of emergency,

5
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.449
all phone lines have been disabled.

6
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.450
No good, huh?

7
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.529
My cell phone has no signal,

8
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.610
and the buses and trains are shut down too.

9
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.620
I guess it'll be impossible
to meet her now.

10
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.160
I've got no choice. I
should head to a shelter.

11
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.720
All missiles have hit the target!

12
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.130
Sorry I made you wait!

13
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.969
The target is still unharmed. It's
continuing to advance towards Tokyo-3.

14
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240
The Air Force is unable to stop it!

15
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.259
Throw everything at it! Have
even the 4th Division open fire!

16
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.580
Spare no expense! Destroy
the target at all costs!

17
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.970
How the hell?! We made direct hits!!

18
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.719
The tank battalion was
completely destroyed.

19
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.610
Missiles and artillery are useless...

20
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.070
It's pointless! This type of firepower's
not going to get us anywhere!

21
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.229
So, it has an AT Field after all?

22
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.820
Yes...

23
00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.660
Conventional weapons are
useless against an Angel.

24
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.210
Understood. We'll deploy
it according to plan.

25
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.159
No way... it can't be...!

26
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.880
They're going to use an N2 Mine?!

27
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.520
Get down!

28
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.190
We did it!

29
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.510
It seems you won't be needed this time.

30
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.660
Shockwave incoming!

31
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.849
Are you okay?

32
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.199
Yeah... but I think I got
some sand in my mouth.

33
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.250
Great! Here, help me out...

34
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.609
Get ready...

35
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.210
And PUSH!

36
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.269
Thanks! Couldn't have done it myself.

37
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.180
No, I should be thanking
you, Katsuragi-san.

38
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.929
Call me Misato, alright?

39
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.770
It's nice to meet you, Ikari Shinji-kun.

40
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.810
Yeah.

41
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.555
What is the target's status?

42
00:05:02.556 --> 00:05:05.190
Due to radio interference, the
target cannot be confirmed.

43
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.190
With that explosion, it
must be obliterated.

44
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.420
Restoring visual.

45
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.600
And that was our trump card...

46
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.609
How is this possible...

47
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.170
Goddamn monster!

48
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.769
Thank God my Renault still works!

49
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.669
It'd be no joke for this car to die on me, since
I've still got 12 payments left on the lease...

50
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.299
Anyway, I called ahead to reserve
an express train for us,

51
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.800
so we might still make it in time!

52
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.860
Say, don't you have any
questions for me, Shinji-kun?

53
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.890
N-no.

54
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.240
I've been the only one
talking here, you know!

55
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
Sorry...

56
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.469
Oh, it's nothing to apologize over,

57
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.639
but I was sure you were going to
ask "What was that giant thing?,"

58
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.739
or maybe, "What's going on here?"

59
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.299
you know, those sorts of things?

60
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.660
Um, well...

61
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.940
I don't see the point, since I didn't
think you'd give me an answer anyway.

62
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.919
Wow, you sure jump to wrong
conclusions, don't you?

63
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.600
That's something adults do, not teenagers!

64
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.669
It's okay.

65
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.760
I'm just following my directions.

66
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.560
Oh?... never mind then.

67
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.650
Just for your information, that thing was a
mysterious life form we call an "Angel."

68
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.200
The 4th Angel...

69
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.519
It possesses an astounding
regenerative capacity.

70
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.899
Complete by itself, it is a
nearly-perfect living creature.

71
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.020
Of course it can regenerate.

72
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.790
Because Angels partook of the
Fruit of Life, you mean?

73
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.630
Yes. They exist to exterminate us... we,
who partook of the Fruit of Wisdom.

74
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.130
The gate is closing. Please be careful.

75
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.469
"Secret Military Agency NERV"...?

76
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.430
Yes, it's a private organization under
the direct control of the U.N..

77
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.799
That's where my father is?

78
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.949
Well, yeah...

79
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.520
Do you know what your dad's job is?

80
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.439
"Work of utmost importance in
the protection of humanity."

81
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.980
That's what my teacher said.

82
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.360
From here on, you will be in
command of this operation.

83
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.559
Show us what you can do.

84
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.809
Understood.

85
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.960
Ikari-kun, I have to admit that nothing in
our arsenal is effective against the target.

86
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.250
So you claim you can defeat this thing?

87
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.090
NERV exists for that very purpose.

88
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.380
Are we going to where my father is?

89
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.890
Yeah, I imagine he'll be there.

90
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.020
Father...

91
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.470
By the way, did your father
send you an ID card?

92
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.920
Ah, yeah.

93
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.420
Here you go.

94
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600
Thanks.

95
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.200
Here, read this please.

96
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.160
NERV.

97
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.249
My father's work.

98
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.200
Is there something I'm needed for?

99
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.419
Of course. He wouldn't send me a letter
if he didn't need me for something.

100
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.840
I see, you don't get
along with your father.

101
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.020
Me neither.

102
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.970
Amazing!

103
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.459
A real GeoFront!

104
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.140
That's right.

105
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.690
And that is our secret
base; NERV Headquarters.

106
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.490
It's humanity's fortress, the
cornerstone to rebuilding our world.

107
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.729
Let's see... from the
terminal's Western exit,

108
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.699
Go north to the 3rd gate and take a right.

109
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.750
Then, we need to take Route 8...

110
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.420
Could they have made this
facility any more complicated?

111
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.029
Hmm... this looks like the correct route...

112
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.220
Um, are we lost?

113
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.369
I'm just not used to this place yet.

114
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.350
Either way, if we keep heading
forward we'll eventually get there!

115
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.549
Secondary cooling cycle complete.

116
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.350
All personnel, evacuate
the tank immediately.

117
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.689
I want the left arm's conductive
plating defrosted and ready to go

118
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.779
within the next three minutes!

119
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.009
And don't forget that apoptosis data!

120
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.520
Roger!

121
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.660
Attention Professor Akagi: Chief Operations Officer Lt. Colonel
Katsuragi, together with one young boy, have arrived at Shaft S36.

122
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.100
What a surprise.

123
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.870
She's late yet again.

124
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.500
Ah... Ritsuko!

125
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:39.409
You're 12 minutes past schedule. You were taking so long,
I came to greet you personally, Lt. Colonel Katsuragi.

126
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.470
We're short on staff and out of time.

127
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.660
Eh... Sorry!

128
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.379
Is this the boy?

129
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.210
Yup.

130
00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:53.399
I'm the Chief Engineer and Administrator
of NERV's Project E, Akagi Ritsuko.

131
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.440
It's nice to meet you.

132
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.190
M-me too.

133
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:58.200
Well then, I'll leave things here to you.

134
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.749
It'll be their first meeting in 3 years...

135
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.189
Deputy Commander! The
target has begun to move!

136
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.229
Understood.

137
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.210
All units, Level One battle stations!

138
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.009
I repeat, all units, Level
One battle stations!

139
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.510
Ground forces, prepare for combat!

140
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.300
Ikari Shinij-kun, there's
something I want to show you.

141
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:35.059
The ultimate man-made multipurpose fighting
machine. The artificial human, Evangelion.

142
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.060
That is Unit 01.

143
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.199
Mankind's very last trump card.

144
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.279
This is my father's work?

145
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.490
Correct.

146
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.320
It's been a while.

147
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.220
Father...

148
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.280
Prepare to sortie.

149
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.889
Sortie?!

150
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.330
But Unit 00 is still frozen, isn't it?

151
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.960
Unless... You intend to use Unit 01?

152
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.670
There is no other choice.

153
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.839
Ikari Shinji-kun...?

154
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.840
Y-Yes?

155
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.980
You will pilot it.

156
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.110
Why did you call me here, Father?

157
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.989
For the same reason you're thinking.

158
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.570
I'm supposed to pilot this and fight
that thing I just saw outside?

159
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.740
Correct.

160
00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:26.700
I don't want to! What are you
saying all of a sudden?!

161
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.660
I thought you didn't need me!
That's why you left!

162
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.530
I need you now, so I called for you.

163
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.499
Why... me?

164
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.840
Because no one else can.

165
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.749
I can't do it...

166
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.380
I've never seen or heard of this thing.

167
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.840
I just can't!

168
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.260
We'll explain it to you.

169
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.920
No...

170
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.129
I can't do it!

171
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.930
There's no way I can do this!

172
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.189
If you're going to pilot it, do it now.
If not...

173
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.270
Leave!

174
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.450
So, we've been found...

175
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.359
Armored hulls 1 through
8 have been breached!

176
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.359
Shinji-kun, there isn't much time.

177
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.540
Widespread fire alarms in Block D.
Closing all fire doors in the area.

178
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960
Pilot it!

179
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.509
No!

180
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.760
Sure, I came all this way...
but this is impossible!

181
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.260
Shinji-kun, why did you come here?

182
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.150
Don't run away. You have to face your
father... and more importantly, yourself.

183
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:43.180
I know that! But I just can't do this!

184
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.940
Fuyutsuki.

185
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.689
Wake up Rei.

186
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.019
Can we use her?

187
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.080
She's not dead.

188
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.860
Understood.

189
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.440
Rei.

190
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440
Yes.

191
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:05.409
The backup is useless.
We need you once more.

192
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.410
Yes.

193
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.300
Switch Unit 01's core unit to the
L-00 type and reactivate it!

194
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.359
Roger. Suspending current tasks.
Reactivating.

195
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.709
Entering reactivation command.

196
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.900
I knew it. I was never needed...

197
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.279
The Target has broken through
the final defence line,

198
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.780
and is proceeding to head right above us.

199
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.250
Are you alright?

200
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:25.869
I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I
mustn't run away, I mustn't run away...

201
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.870
I mustn't run away!

202
00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.010
I'll do it.

203
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.550
I'll pilot it.

204
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.969
Third cooling cycle, complete.

205
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.510
Flywheel rotation shutdown.

206
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.829
Unlocking the connectors.

207
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.310
No problems with the auxiliary power.

208
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.520
Shutdown signal plug extraction complete.

209
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.439

210
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.970
Unlocking spinal conductive network.
Prepare for connection.

211
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.439
Probe needle insertion complete.

212
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.739

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.330
Maintaining range between
plus-02 and minus-05.

214
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.879
Locking down interior array.

215
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.960
Roger, starting first contact.

216
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.170
Flooding Entry Plug.

217
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.640
W-What is this?

218
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.219
It's alright.

219
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.550
Once the LCL fills your lungs, it will
provide oxygen directly to your blood.

220
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.350
You'll get used to it.

221
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.759
Main power source connection complete.

222
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.440
Roger.

223
00:15:22.441 --> 00:15:24.439
Starting second contact.

224
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.690

norm for cognitive interface.

228
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.119
No problems detected with initial contacts.

229
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.250
Communication lines open.

230
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.250
Points on the list up to 1405, all clear.

231
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.790
Measuring synapse levels.
Synchronization rate, 41.3%.

232
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.129
And he's not even wearing a plug suit!
Amazing!

233
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.349
Harmonics are in normal levels.
Everything's under control.

234
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.350
We are ready!

235
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.350
Prepare to launch!

236
00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.950
Prepare to launch!

237
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.680
Release primary lock bolts!

238
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.629
Release confirmed.

239
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.890
Initiating retraction of umbilical bridge.

240
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.110
Release secondary lock bolts!

241
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.869
Removing primary restraints.

242
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.410
Proceeding to remove secondary restraints.

243
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.619
Disengaging safety systems 01 through 15.

244
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.040
Disengagement confirmed.

245
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.629
Unit 01 is now free.

246
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.469
Internal power supply, fully charged.

247
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.380
No problems with the external power socket.

248
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.760
Understood. Move Unit 01 to the launch pad.

249
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.629
No problems with the positioning
of any of the linear rail tracks.

250
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.010
Electromagnetic induction
system, working normally.

251
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.770
Unit 01 is now moving to K-52.

252
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.350
Launch sequence is proceeding normally.

253
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.690
Eva has arrived at the launch terminal hub.

254
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.320
Launch tube clear. All green!

255
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.839
Launch preparations complete.

256
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.840
Understood.

257
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.989
I have your approval?

258
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.210
Absolutely.

259
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.540
Our future depends on defeating the Angels.

260
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.420
Ikari, you're absolutely sure about this?

261
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.670
LAUNCH!

262
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.190
Are you alright, Shinji-kun?

263
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.430
Y-Yes.

264
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.370
Release the final safety lock!

265
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.250
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!

266
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.450
Shinji-kun...

267
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.290
for now, just concentrate on walking.

268
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.880
Walk...

269
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.930
It walked!

270
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.100
Walk...

271
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.129
Shinji-kun, stay alert!

272
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.870
Hurry...

273
00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:24.730
Hurry and get back up!

274
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.689
Shinji-kun, calm down!

275
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.720
It's not really your arm that's being hurt!

276
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.899
What happened to Eva's defensive systems?

277
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.359
Signal inactive!

278
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.419
The field isn't expending.

279
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420
It's not working?

280
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.360
The left arm is damaged!

281
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.090
Circuits are going off-line!

282
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.730
Shinji-kun, dodge!!

283
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.569
Frontal cranium is fracturing!

284
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.080
Its armour can't withstand much more!

285
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.670
Cranial damage, severity unknown!

286
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.380
Operational integrity compromised!

287
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.340
What's the status?

288
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.010
Synchro graph inverting!
Pulse entering reflux!

289
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.919
Cut off the circuits! Block the flow!

290
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.600
We can't!

291
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.719
The signal's being refused,
we can't get through!

292
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.600
Shinji-kun's status?!

293
00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.600
No response from the monitoring system.
Condition unknown!

294
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.480
Unit 01 has gone silent.

295
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.590
Misato!

296
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.589
That's it!

297
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.179
Abort the operation! Pilot
rescue has top priority!

298
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.690
Emergency plug ejection!

299
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.990
We can't! It's not responding!

300
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.320
What?!

301
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.059
The Eva has reactivated!

302
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.910
Impossible...

303
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:55.750
It should be knocked out!

304
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.070
Has it gone...

305
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.360
Berserk?!

306
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.730
We've won.

307
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.820
An AT-Field?

308
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.739
It's pointless. Unless the
AT Field is breached...

309
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.330
you can't do anything to an Angel.

310
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.569
Left arm restored!

311
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.570
Amazing!

312
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.089
Unit 01 has also raised an AT-Field!

313
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.299
Angel phase space is being neutralized.

314
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.430
No. It's corroding it.

315
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.810
It broke through that AT-Field
like it was nothing...

316
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.190
What is Eva's status?

317
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.340
Is this Eva's...

318
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.260
True form?

319
00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.219
Have you decided on a name?

320
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.299
If it's a boy, Shinji. If
it's a girl, then Rei.

321
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.979
Shinji...

322
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.490
Rei...

323
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.700
Shinji...

324
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.890
Shinji... Ayanami.

325
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.800
Shinji...

326
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640
Rei...

327
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.520
Rei... Ikari...?

328
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.070
Rei...

329
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.040
No...

330
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.050
Ayanami... Rei!

331
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.280
An unfamiliar ceiling...

332
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.670
The attack of the fourth
Angel, and its defeat...

333
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.009
Then the acquisition of the Third Child...

334
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.920
And the activation of Eva Unit 01...

335
00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.380
Overall the plan is progressing well.

336
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.789
Well, except for the colossal expense
necessary to repair Unit 01.

337
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.179
Compared to Unit 00 in cryo-suspension,

338
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.640
that is hardly a problem.

339
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.099
Eva Unit 01's recovery
operation is complete.

340
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.739
Right now, it's being locked into Cage 6.

341
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.479
A full-systems check will
commence at 10:00 hours.

342
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.279
And the recording from
when it went berserk?

343
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.649
It was blank. Absolutely
nothing was recorded.

344
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.419
And so, we have no idea what the cause was.

345
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.490
Our absolute confidence in its combat
performance... may be a bit misplaced.

346
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:05.420
As long as it can fight the 5th
Angel, minor bugs are tolerable.

347
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.929
No need for concern.

348
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.189
We'll continue deployment of Unit 01.

349
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.599
And Unit 02 and its pilot in Germany are
under deployment qualification exams.

350
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.759
The construction of Unit 03 is
also progressing as planned.

351
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.559
It's your responsibility to make
proper use of NERV and the Evas.

352
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.099
We earnestly hope you
will not disappoint us.

353
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.729
That's right. Defeating the Angels is but one
step in fulfilling our contract with Lilith.

354
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.690
The Human Instrumentality Project...

355
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.579
Its execution is our ultimate goal.

356
00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.070
I understand. Everything will go
according to SEELE's scenario.

357
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.770
An Angel leaves quite a mark when it's
destroyed after it loses its AT Field.

358
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.259
The blood is like a lake from hell...

359
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.730
It's got the same nasty
feeling as the Second Impact.

360
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.610
Our Eva can defeat an Angel...

361
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.530
That alone will give
humanity a glimmer of hope.

362
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.830
Well, looks the pilot of hope just woke up.

363
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.309
Paging Chief Internist Dr. Ugai. Dr. Ugai.

364
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.900
Please contact Dr. Azuma in the Emergency
Surgical Ward as soon as possible.

365
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.979
The B Incident Grand Rounds will
momentarily begin, according to schedule.

366
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.230
Would the event directors please make their
way to conference room 2? Thank you.

367
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.659
Alone?

368
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.620
Yes, he's been assigned quarters
in Block 6. That all right?

369
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:07.849
Yes.

370
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.850
Is that really okay?

371
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.100
Shinji-kun?

372
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.080
It's fine. I'm always alone.

373
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.130
It's always the same wherever I go.

374
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.050
What?!

375
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.139
Like I was saying, I'm taking Shinji
back to my place to live with me.

376
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.949
I have authorization from above.

377
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.250
Don't worry, I wouldn't lay a
hand on a little boy like him.

378
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.239
Of course you won't! Honestly, what are you
thinking?! Don't even say things like this!

379
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.350
She could never take a joke...

380
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.130
All right, we're gonna
having a party tonight!

381
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.620
What for?

382
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.040
To welcome my new room-mate, of course!

383
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.109
So you've decided to move?

384
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:53.199
Yes, I never thought this city
would become a battlefield.

385
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.409
Indeed! My husband wants me and
the children to leave here too!

386
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.489
I heard that just today, over
100 people left the city.

387
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:08.699
This may be a fortress city, but those
people at NERV seem rather incompetent.

388
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.389
I get chills just thinking
about what happened yesterday.

389
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.020
I know...

390
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.480
Sorry,

391
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.379
but we're going to take a slight detour.

392
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.380
Where to?

393
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.660
Some place special.

394
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.160
This city...

395
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.960
seems so lonely, doesn't it?

396
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.040
It's time.

397
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:12.870
Amazing...

398
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.670
Buildings are sprouting out of the ground!

399
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.350
This is the special fortress-city
for intercepting Angels.

400
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.630
Tokyo-3.

401
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.770
This is our city...

402
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.730
And the city that you protected.

403
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.330
Looks like your things have
already been delivered.

404
00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.920
To tell the truth, I've only
moved to this city recently.

405
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.540
All right, come on in.

406
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.290
Um...

407
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.800
Pardon the intrusion.

408
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.350
Shinji-kun, this is your home now.

409
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.600
I'm... I'm home.

410
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.380
Welcome home.

411
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.069
Ah yeah...

412
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.360
It's a little messy in here,
but try to ignore it.

413
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.540
Is this...

414
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.210
a little?

415
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.370
Oh sorry, could you put the
food in the fridge please?

416
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.040
Ah, sure!

417
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.210
Ice...

418
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.830
Snacks...

419
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.130
And nothing but beer?

420
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.010
What kind of life does she lead?

421
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.169
Let's dig in!

422
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.220
Let's eat...

423
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:03.390
Ah, I love it! This is what
makes life worth living!

424
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.800
Not hungry? For instant
food, it's pretty good.

425
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.070
Well... I'm just not used
to this sort of meal.

426
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.870
No! You just can't be so picky!

427
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.500
No, that's not it... Um...

428
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.170
Isn't this fun...?

429
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.460
Having a meal with another person?

430
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.910
Uh... yes.

431
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.550
All right!

432
00:30:29.551 --> 00:30:34.390
Since this is your home now,
feel free to just let loose!

433
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.349
Y-Yes...

434
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.870
Come on... This "Yes, yes, yes,
yes." is getting on my nerves...

435
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.900
You're a boy aren't you?!
Show some backbone, will you!

436
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.510
Yes.

437
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.150
Well, whatever.

438
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.030
Once you'll get in the bath, all those bad
feelings will just wash away in an instant!

439
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.160
Bathing lets you wash your life anew.

440
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.210
M-M-Misato-san!

441
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.870
What?

442
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.350
Ah, him? He's my pet bird. They
call them hot spring penguins.

443
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.810
Birds like that actually exist?!

444
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.280
They used to be a lot more common
15 years ago. His name is Pen-pen.

445
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.680
He'll be your other room-mate in this house.

446
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.870
Anyway... shouldn't you be covering that?

447
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:48.420
Maybe I'm being overly flamboyant... he
might be able to see right through me.

448
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.800
Katsuragi Misato-san...

449
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.639
She's not a bad person.

450
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.430
Bathing lets you wash your life anew!

451
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.270
I tend to remember bad
things when I'm in a bath...

452
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.690
How was Rei doing?

453
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.710
You went to her hospital
this afternoon, no?

454
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.409
There are no problems. Preparing to restart
the frozen Unit 00 is more important.

455
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.990
Are you sure about using your son? His
mental state seems to be very unstable.

456
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:26.499
Don't worry about him. His condition will give
us the perfect pretext to reinstate Unit 00.

457
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.420
We'll proceed according to Lt. Colonel
Katsuragi's suggestion, then.

458
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.649
Even without a preliminary report, they
suddenly selected him as the Third Child.

459
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.980
And as if in response, the
Fourth Angel attacks.

460
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.190
In addition, Commander Ikari
forces his son to pilot.

461
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.369
I certainly feel very
uneasy about that fact...

462
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:04.720
But still, even after successfully defeating
that Angel, I feel surprisingly...

463
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.540
unhappy.

464
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.710
Another unfamiliar ceiling...

465
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.649
No surprise...

466
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.930
Nothing about this city is familiar.

467
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.010
This is your home now.

468
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.350
Why am I even here?

469
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.730
Shinji-kun? I'm coming in.

470
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.290
I forgot to tell you something.

471
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.580
You've done a wonderful
thing worth praising today.

472
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.630
You should be proud.

473
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.590
Goodnight, Shinji-kun.

474
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.670
Hang in there.

475
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.089
Sorry, transfer kid. I had to hit ya.

476
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.770
To settle the score with you.

477
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:15.339
Real sorry. That guy's little sister was
injured in that big incident the other day.

478
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.380
That's just how it is with him.

479
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.770
It's not like I piloted
it because I wanted to.

480
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.019
How is this something
people would praise me for?

481
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.730
Why do I have to get hit just
because I piloted the Eva?

482
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.239
Is everything alright, Shinji-kun?

483
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:55.930
Yes.

484
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.490
Within each Angel there is a central core.

485
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:05.160
The only way to defeat an Angel
directly is to destroy that core.

486
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.120
Therefore, centre on target,
then pull the trigger.

487
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.859
This way, you can dispose of them
accurately if you master the process.

488
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.860
Okay.

489
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.029
Good. Continue practising
like this in induction mode.

490
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.030
Okay.

491
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.969
Still, I'm quite surprised Shinji-kun
suddenly changed his mind about piloting...

492
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:42.610
That boy only gets through life by silently
obeying whatever people tell him, doesn't he?

493
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.990
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

494
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.450
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

495
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.470
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

496
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.290
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

497
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.429
Which reminds me...

498
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.579
Wasn't Shinji-kun hit by one of
his classmates at his new school?

499
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.059
Is our pilot security sufficient?

500
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.049
There's no problem with our
intelligence department's surveillance.

501
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.959
Besides, it wasn't very bad.

502
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.959
It would better if we stayed
out of his private life.

503
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.829
Doesn't he live with you?

504
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.230
His maintenance is your
responsibility too, you know.

505
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.900
That's just it.

506
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.070
It's difficult... He's far
more naïve than I expected.

507
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.969
Hah, complaining already?

508
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.619
You were the one who was so
adamant about taking him in.

509
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.080
Quiet, you.

510
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:42.990
You're right, he doesn't have much
of a personality for making friends.

511
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.069
Have you heard of the "Hedgehog's dilemma"?

512
00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:49.269
Hedgehog? The little spiky things?

513
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.520
Hedgehogs have a hard time sharing
warmth with other hedgehogs.

514
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:58.649
The closer they become, the
more they hurt each other.

515
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.790
People are like that as well.

516
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.069
Like with Shinji-kun right now.

517
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.410
The more pain his heart endures,
the more afraid he becomes.

518
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.790
Well, eventually he'll realize.

519
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:20.840
Becoming an adult means drawing close
and growing apart over and over...

520
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:25.570
and discovering the way to
avoid wounding one another.

521
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.760
I certainly hope so.

522
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:34.039
Anyway, when are we gonna get budget
approval to upgrade Block B here?

523
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.319
Eva's maintenance and armaments
are the top priority.

524
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.990
Maybe there's no money left?

525
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.400
My ass is freezing!

526
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.580
An emergency call...

527
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.290
I'll go on ahead.

528
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.659
We have direct visual of inbound object.

529
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.679
E747 has also confirmed the object.

530
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.180
Analysis indicates Pattern Blue. There's
no doubt. It's the fifth Angel.

531
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.559
All hands, level one battle stations!

532
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.429
Roger, ground-to-air missiles ready!.

533
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.070
Tokyo-3 entering combat configuration.

534
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.570
Retracting central block.

535
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.630
Center block and Districts One through
Seven's retraction is complete.

536
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.289
All governmental departments
have been notified.

537
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.069
Target continuing inbound movement.

538
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.220
The anti-air interception
system is 48% activated.

539
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.959
Status of non-combatants and civilians?

540
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.640
We've already received a
complete evacuation report.

541
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:44.959
All Elementary and Middle School student classes,
please gather in your designated blocks.

542
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.060
There is a lost child at shelter
number 323 in Sector Seven.

543
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.060
It's happening again.

544
00:39:48.061 --> 00:39:49.990
Just text again?

545
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.759
They're controlling the broadcast.

546
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.120
They won't show us regular
citizens anything.

547
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.410
Not even a big event like this!

548
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.250
This is a waste of tax money.

549
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.050
Some people just aren't happy
unless they burn through some ammo.

550
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.879
The Japanese government is demanding
we send out the Evangelion.

551
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.260
How annoying. It's not like we weren't
going to do that without their orders.

552
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:23.729
We've started the entry. Ionizing LCL.

553
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.860
Father's not even watching me...
Why am I piloting this again?

554
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.860
People hate me for this...

555
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.629
Hey, I wanna talk to you
about something, alone.

556
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:37.719
What about?

557
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.370
Just for a minute, okay?

558
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.710
Alright, alright...

559
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.239
Right, right, and then-

560
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.519
Class Rep!

561
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.080
What?

562
00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:46.329
We, uh, both need to take a leak!

563
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.040
Geez, make it quick!!

564
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.279
So, what's this about?

565
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.199
I want to see it at least
once before I die!

566
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.319
That battle up there?

567
00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.279
This is the real deal! If I don't go now,
who knows when I'll get another chance...

568
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.759
Jeez, Kensuke, what is it with you?

569
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.109
"If you waste this moment,
you may waste everything."

570
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:09.059
Come on... Just help me get past the gate.

571
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:13.860
Guess I've got no choice. You're a real
slave to your passions, aren't you?

572
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.240
Shinji-kun, are you ready for launch?

573
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:19.679
Yes.

574
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.659
Remember. Continuous Gatling gun
fire as you neutralize its AT Field.

575
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.810
Just like in practice. You'll be fine.

576
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.710
Yes...

577
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:28.890
Launch!

578
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:46.919
Incredible! This was worth the trouble!

579
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.520
Yes! This is what I've been waiting for!

580
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.900
It's here.

581
00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.180
- Center on target, then pull the trigger.
- Expanding A.T. Field.

582
00:42:00.183 --> 00:42:02.330
Center on target, then pull the trigger.

583
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.549
Proceed according to the
plans, okay, Shinji-kun?

584
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.600
Yes.

585
00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.500
Idiot! All that smoke is
obscuring the target!

586
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.319
The heck? He's gettin' his ass kicked!

587
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.270
He's fine!

588
00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:32.520
We're sending up a spare rifle!

589
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.110
Grab it!

590
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.740
Shinji-kun...? Shinji-kun?!

591
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:43.249
Oh man... Your beating
must have shaken him up.

592
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.330
Sh-Shut up!

593
00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.809
Umbilical Cable has been severed!

594
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.759
Eva switching to internal power supply!

595
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.520
Operational time remaining
is 4 minutes 53 seconds!

596
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:16.780
It's coming this way!

597
00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.299
Shinji-kun, are you all right?! Shinji-kun!

598
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.300
Damage report?

599
00:43:25.301 --> 00:43:27.070
No problems. He's good to go.

600
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.369
Shinji-kun's classmates?!

601
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:39.550
What are they doing there?!

602
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.189
Why isn't he fighting back?!

603
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:53.440
Maybe he can't move freely...
because we're here!?

604
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.170
Unit 01 will reach operational time
limit in 3 minutes 28 seconds!

605
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.940
Palm armour overheating. Damage, 58%.

606
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.160
Shinji-kun, let those two into the cockpit!

607
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.750
Once they're in, get out of there!
We'll start over afterwards.

608
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.790
You two, get in, quickly!

609
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.689
What the... Is this water?!

610
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.960
My camera! My camera!

611
00:44:20.961 --> 00:44:21.980
System restarting.

612
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.930
Palm surface meltdown has reached
the 3rd protective layer!

613
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.440
Now's your chance! Retreat!

614
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.925
Use escape route 34. Retreat on
the eastern side of the mountain.

615
00:44:45.926 --> 00:44:47.530
Hey, transfer kid, she said "retreat!"

616
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.450
I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away...
I mustn't run away...

617
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200
Transfer kid!

618
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.500
Progressive Knife equipped!

619
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.420
Shinji-kun, listen to my order!
Fall back now!

620
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.700
Shinji-kun!

621
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:08.900
That idiot!

622
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.030
Unit 01 will reach operational
time limit in 30 seconds.

623
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.549
28, 27, 26...

624
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:38.330
25, 24, 23, 22...

625
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.800
13, 12, 11, 10...

626
00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.440
9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

627
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.570
4, 3, 2, 1...

628
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.669
Eva Unit 01 has ceased operation.

629
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.530
Target has completely disintegrated.

630
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.820
Why did you ignore my orders?

631
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:51.820
I'm sorry.

632
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:54.660
I am your operational supervisor, am I not?

633
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.260
Yes.

634
00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.210
It's your duty to follow
the orders I give you.

635
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.470
Do you understand?

636
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.070
Yes.

637
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.090
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

638
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.010
Yes.

639
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.630
Do you really understand
what I'm telling you?

640
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.910
Yes, I understand, Misato-san.

641
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.230
It's fine, we won, didn't we?

642
00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.180
I'll pilot it if you tell me to.
Isn't that what you want?

643
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.780
That's enough. Go back and get some rest.

644
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.490
Next stop is Nagao Pass. Nagao Pass.

645
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.730
Please exit to the right.

646
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.339
He doesn't plan on coming home...

647
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.340
That idiot.

648
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.040
Ikari, Ikari Shinji.

649
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.169
What's this? He just got here,
and he's already absent?

650
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:52.250
Oh well. Now then, I'll hand back
the tests from the other day.

651
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:33.910
I've had enough of this!

652
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.090
Please take me back to Misato-san!

653
00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.990
Did your little stroll clear things
up for you, Ikari Shinji-kun?

654
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:10.950
Not really. It didn't really matter.
Nothing does.

655
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.920
I don't have any freedom anyway.

656
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:19.089
I have no choice but to pilot Eva, do I?

657
00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:21.420
That's the only reason my father
called for me, after all.

658
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.069
Fine. I'll pilot it.

659
00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:28.060
If that's what everyone
wants, that's what I'll do.

660
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:31.429
You talk about everyone else,
but what about yourself?

661
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.899
I know I can't do this. I bet
everybody else does, too.

662
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.979
But Ayanami is hurt, and
you and father want...

663
00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.269
Cut it out!

664
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.599
This has nothing to do with anyone else!

665
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.929
You need to decide if you want
to be the pilot for the Eva.

666
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.899
You're free to go if you want to.

667
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.250
You have all the freedom you want.
Do as you please!

668
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.590
In the end, your son's actions
followed the plan to the letter.

669
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.550
Yes. Next we must make
him and Rei get closer.

670
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.070
All is according to plan.

671
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.239
A scenario written out 14 years ago.

672
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.440
These poor children's fates
have already been determined.

673
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:17.940
Don't you find that a bit harsh?

674
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:27.410
C'mon, hurry it up! And don't hold back!

675
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:30.529
If you don't do this, I won't
feel like it's settled!

676
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.080
Well, that's just the kind of straightforward
guy he is. I'm counting on you.

677
00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.800
Now we're even. I'm sorry
for hitting you, Ikari.

678
00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.650
Go, go, Kayoko!

679
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:02.109
If you lose, you're buying us a pizza!

680
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.269
That's it! Go, go, go!

681
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:04.070
In your dreams!!

682
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:06.230
Please! Give me one more chance!!

683
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:08.099
Ew, the boys are peeping!

684
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:08.770
Pervs!

685
00:53:08.771 --> 00:53:09.869
That's naughty!

686
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:11.740
Suzuhara's gaze is so lewd!

687
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.660
Ikari-kun~!

688
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.960
Ayanami Rei, age 14.

689
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:23.119
She was the first candidate
chosen by the Marduk Institute.

690
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.639
The First Child.

691
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.269
Specifically, she is the exclusive operator
of the prototype Evangelion, Unit 00.

692
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:33.179
Her personal history is blank.
Completely erased.

693
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.640
So, to save her, my father...

694
00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.009
Critical error in start-up system!

695
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.709
Failures in Stage 3 routines!

696
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.079
Nervous system elements rejected.

697
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.900
The main transmission system is scrambled!
It's overflowing!

698
00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.530
Neural pulse flow reversing!
I'm unable to stop it!

699
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.660
Direct camera feed, down!

700
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:52.660
Entry plug unstable. Eva
is refusing to release it!

701
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.870
Abort contacts. Close off all
circuits up to number six.

702
00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.540
I can't! The signal won't go through!

703
00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:01.580
Unit 00 is out of control!

704
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.879
Abort the test. Cut all power.

705
00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.880
Yes, sir!

706
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:12.979
Unit 00 has switched to auxiliary power.

707
00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.349
35 seconds to total system shutdown.

708
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.270
Fail-safe system has yet to activate.

709
00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.190
It's dangerous! Please step back!

710
00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.200
The auto-eject has activated!

711
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.350
Oh no!

712
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:36.739
We still cannot control Unit 00!

713
00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.260
Quickly, release specialized Bakelite!

714
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800
Rei!

715
00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.879
Ten seconds to complete shutdown!

716
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.869
8, 7, 6, 5...

717
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:54.460
4, 3, 2, 1.

718
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.810
Unit 00 has ceased all activity.

719
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.700
Rei, are you alright?

720
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.500
Rei!

721
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.210
That's good.

722
00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:30.059
It was so sudden. I couldn't believe it.

723
00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:34.050
It was deleted from the official
report, but it's an undisputed fact.

724
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:38.059
Unit 00 just went berserk,
and is still being unfrozen.

725
00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.569
Isn't that a bit hasty?

726
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.000
The Angels have reappeared. It's our top
priority to reinforce our military strength.

727
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.610
That's true, but...

728
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.699
We've already run
reactivation tests with Rei.

729
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.610
Unit 00 itself is ready.

730
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.590
Once the adjustments to the
nerve connections are complete.

731
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:58.500
It's so we can re-deploy it soon, isn't it?

732
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:04.749
Ayanami...

733
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.289
Why is she always alone?

734
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.850
Eva Unit 01 is beginning
third coolant phase.

735
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.920
Please set all systems in
Cage 6 to phase three.

736
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:19.780
Copying the all-range data of the
entry plug to Melchior. Data sent.

737
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.519
Begin third cooling phase.

738
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.939
Copying situation data
from Casper to Melchior.

739
00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:30.790
Currently, Unit 01's plug depth is at 0,8.
It's within acceptable measurement range.

740
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:35.700
T-minus 150 minutes to Unit 00's
conductive systems restart and testing.

741
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:40.279
Roger. Routine synchronization
test, Program 508 is now complete.

742
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.740
Good work, Shinji-kun.

743
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.639
So, what's it like living with him?

744
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.330
It's alright. I'm getting used to it.

745
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:50.000
Still a little nervous?

746
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.180
It's not your first time
living with a man, is it?

747
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:56.729
This isn't like 8 years ago.

748
00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:58.719
This time, it's not an
intimate relationship.

749
00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.970
I don't know about that...

750
00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.639
Shinji-kun is still here
because of you, isn't he?

751
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.140
You're wrong there.

752
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.900
It's probably because his father's here.

753
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:13.489
He wants his father to acknowledge him.
To pat him on the shoulder.

754
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.100
To praise him, even if it's just one word.

755
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.740
I think he wants a love that
will wipe away his loneliness.

756
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.880
He's conflicted over his father,
just like you are, Misato.

757
00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:31.489
I wonder why Commander Ikari acts
so distant with his own son.

758
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:33.499
And it looks like he talks to Rei a lot.

759
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.880
It's a terrible balance.

760
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:38.880
Lately, it seems like men have no interest
in anything other than themselves.

761
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:41.990
It's a tough time to be a woman, isn't it?

762
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:44.930
Well, then...

763
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.689
It's about time. I have to head back.

764
00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:51.499
You're a worker bee, as always.

765
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:56.249
Take these if you're going home, Misato.
It's Shinji-kun's official security card,

766
00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.149
and Ayanami Rei's renewed card.

767
00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:00.319
I forgot about these.

768
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.120
Could you ask Shinji to give this to her?

769
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.790
Alright.

770
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.750
Ayanami Rei...

771
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:17.460
Why was father smiling with her...?

772
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:20.930
Why won't he smile for me?

773
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.080
Excuse me...

774
00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.880
Excuse me, it's Ikari!

775
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.410
Ayanami, I'm coming in.

776
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:39.760
Could these be Ayanami's?

777
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.600
Oh, no... Um... I...!

778
00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.910
I didn't mean to...

779
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.120
Could you move?

780
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.570
U-um...!

781
01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.210
What is it?

782
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.710
Um... I was... Um...

783
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:03.090
That is...

784
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.930
I... I was asked to... I mean...

785
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.129
The uhhh...

786
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:17.890
The card! The c-card was renewed and...
and I c-came to deliver it...

787
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.110
So... So... It's not
like I was trying to...

788
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:35.049
Ritsuko-san said she forgot
to give it to you. Honestly.

789
01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:39.930
I rang the doorbell, but no one answered...
and the door was unlocked, so...

790
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:54.710
Offices in the Central Dogma
are currently accessible.

791
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.280
Group 3 visitors are requested
to please use Direct Gate 4.

792
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.220
Here's your new card, Ayanami.
Ritsuko-san left it with me.

793
01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.109
Sorry about before.

794
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.110
What for?

795
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:24.620
Say, Ayanami... Aren't you afraid?

796
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.770
About piloting that Evangelion again.

797
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:29.710
Why should I be?

798
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:34.279
I heard you got hurt in that test...

799
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.360
So... Are you really okay?

800
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.510
Yes. I'm okay.

801
01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.030
But... aren't you afraid
it will go berserk again?

802
01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:50.450
Or we could lose to an Angel and die!

803
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:53.950
You're Commander Ikari's son, aren't you?

804
01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:58.700
You don't have faith in your father's work?

805
01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.710
Of course not! Not from a father like him.

806
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580
Um...

807
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:31.179
Monitored object is proceeding
past the Odawara defence Line.

808
01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.240
Object analysis complete.

809
01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.320
Pattern blue. Angel confirmed.

810
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.910
As we thought. The 6th Angel.

811
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.400
Yes.

812
01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.830
Prepare Unit 01 for sortie.

813
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.960
Prepare to launch Unit 01!

814
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.860
Anti-air interception weapons armed.

815
01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.799
The target is passing above Lake Ashinoko.

816
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.720
Evangelion Unit 01 is ready to launch!

817
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.820
Launch!

818
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.899
High energy reaction
detected inside the target!

819
01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.520
What?!

820
01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.620
Don't tell me...!

821
01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400
Get out of there!

822
01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:32.459
Lower synchronization rate to minimum!

823
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.630
Deploy blast shield!

824
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.699
Abort intercept! Begin
emergency recovery of Unit 01!

825
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.290
We can't! The catapult has melted.
It's unusable!

826
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:02.469
What about the AT-Field?

827
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:05.960
Fully raised. Structural integrity
is holding, but barely!

828
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.459
No! No more of this!

829
01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.470
Let me out! Get me out of here, father!!

830
01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.719
Abort the operation!

831
01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.779
Place top priority on the pilot's safety!
Force eject the plug!

832
01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.810
That won't do.

833
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.810
If the pilot is taken out, Eva's
AT-Field will completely disappear!

834
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.400
Things will go from bad to worse.

835
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:32.370
But...

836
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.330
There's no other choice...

837
01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:44.700
Emergency recovery! Blow
the explosive bolts!

838
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.499
The target has ceased fire.

839
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.759
Unit 01 retrieved. Sending to Cage 99!

840
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.810
Rescue team, stand by!

841
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.110
First priority is cooling
the LCL in the plug!

842
01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:16.110
Pilot confirmed! His heart rate is weak.

843
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:19.359
Boost plug suit life support to Max!
Begin cardiac massage!

844
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360
Understood!

845
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.030
Pulse confirmed!

846
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.390
Forcefully eject the plug!

847
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.330
Stabilizing possible rupture
point in the interior.

848
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.999
Begin emergency LCL draining!

849
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
At once!

850
01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:33.880
Draining LCL.

851
01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.050
Hurry emergency treatment!

852
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.550
The target is currently
invading from above.

853
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:18.919
It's in the midst of drilling
through to the Geo-Front.

854
01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.880
Its objective is a direct
attack on our NERV HQ, is it?

855
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.170
Well then, let's hear the results
of each department's analysis.

856
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.479
Judging from the previous battle...

857
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.940
the target automatically engages
any enemy within a certain range.

858
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.169
Meaning it's impossible for Eva to
engage it in close combat, right?

859
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:37.480
How's its AT Field?

860
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.739
Still operational. And
to make matters worse...

861
01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.259
with its phase pattern constantly shifting,
the field's surface is unstable.

862
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.370
Neutralizing it will be very difficult.

863
01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.370
According to Magi's calculations...

864
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:55.470
to pierce the enemy's AT Field, we'd need to drop so many
aerial N2 Mines that it would destroy NERV HQ as well.

865
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.500
The Magi 2 at Matsushiro
reached the same conclusion.

866
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:05.939
Right now, the Japanese government and U.N.
Forces are petitioning NERV HQ to do just that.

867
01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.600
An easy suggestion to make when
they're not the ones in danger.

868
01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.429
If this place falls, then all is lost.

869
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:15.940
However, the drill has already breached
the second layer of armour plating.

870
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.639
It's already begun penetrating the third.

871
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.879
The estimated time from today until
it has passed through all 22 layers,

872
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:28.280
reaching the area above HQ, is
12:06:54 AM tomorrow morning.

873
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.580
We have ten hours and fourteen minutes.

874
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:33.909
To make matters worse, Unit 00 needs to
be calibrated before it's operational.

875
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:37.880
Unit 01 is also currently unmovable
due to its previous injury.

876
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:41.649
The situation sure isn't favourable.

877
01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:44.129
We're certainly backed into a corner.

878
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:46.280
Should we wave the white flag?

879
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:51.720
Maybe... but before we do, I have a
little something I'd like to try.

880
01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.890
The intelligence division should be aware
of the JSSDF's secret weapon, right?

881
01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:16.410
Still, though, it's reckless to use this in
an operation, Operations Chief Katsuragi.

882
01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.340
"Reckless" is a bit rude.

883
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:22.840
It can be done within the remaining nine
hours, and it's the best shot we've got.

884
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.550
Operation Yashima...

885
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.089
As the name suggests, we'll be taking
electrical power from all over Japan.

886
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:35.490
And then direct it toward JSSDF's secret
prototype weapon, a high power positron cannon.

887
01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:43.520
Since it's unfinished, and can't be used on its
own, it's been modified for Eva to control it.

888
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.280
Convincing the U.N. Forces is one thing, but
the Ministry of Home Affairs and JSSDF, too?

889
01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.020
Let's just say they owe me a few favours.

890
01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.150
You sure are good at what you do.

891
01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:06.630
From midnight tonight to before dawn tomorrow, the
entire country will experience a large-scale blackout.

892
01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.920
We ask for everyone's cooperation.
I repeat...

893
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.319
From midnight tonight to before dawn tomorrow, the
entire country will experience a large-scale blackout.

894
01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.270
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

895
01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:19.490
Alright. Let's go.

896
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.270
Yeah.

897
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:27.279
From midnight tonight to before dawn tomorrow, the
entire country will experience a large-scale blackout.

898
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.240
We ask for everyone's cooperation.

899
01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.300
The Angel has penetrated
through the 7th armoured plate!

900
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.010
What's the status of our energy system?

901
01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:01.119
Power will be fed directly from the Shingotenba
substation and two backup generators!

902
01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.859
Superconductor power lines now being
laid towards lower Futagoyama.

903
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:11.450
The transformer relay system is scheduled to
be up and running at 10:50 PM Japan time.

904
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.370
How's progress on the sniping system?

905
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:17.540
No problems in assembly. We'll have no trouble
making it by the operation start time.

906
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:19.200
What is Unit 01's status?

907
01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:22.540
It's currently being outfitted
with G-type sniping equipment.

908
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.710
It will be ready to deploy in two hours.

909
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:27.500
Roger that! All that's
left now is the pilot.

910
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:31.340
But I wonder... Will he be
willing to pilot it again?

911
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.390
What do you plan to do
about Unit 01's pilot?

912
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.720
It's too soon to test
the dummy plug system.

913
01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.389
We have no other practical means other
than letting the current pilot handle it.

914
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:47.649
In the worst case, do we brainwash him?

915
01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:50.290
If things don't work
out, there's always Rei.

916
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:55.010
Rei in Unit 01? Isn't that a bit too risky?

917
01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.160
We must use whatever means are available to us.
We still have eight Angels we must defeat.

918
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.870
And then, we realize our goal...

919
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:16.260
I hate it... piloting the Eva.

920
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.699
If I do it well, no one
praises me for doing it.

921
01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.230
If I fail, everyone will hate me.
Or, even worse, I could just die.

922
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:27.980
Why am I even here?

923
01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:35.240
I thought things would change here.
That maybe good things would happen.

924
01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.490
I didn't come here to be put through hell.

925
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:41.700
So you plan to spend the rest of your life
running away from everything unpleasant?

926
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:44.550
Live?

927
01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:46.730
Why am I alive, anyway?

928
01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.340
I used to think I didn't
have a choice in the matter.

929
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:55.879
Whether it's my father or
Misato-san, no one really needs me.

930
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.350
If I couldn't pilot Eva, there
would be no need for me.

931
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.970
That's why I have no
choice but to pilot Eva.

932
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.270
That's why I'm able to stay here.

933
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.760
But when I pilot my Eva, I...

934
01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.990
This ceiling again...

935
01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.020
Is this all I get for piloting that thing?

936
01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:24.500
Ayanami...?

937
01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.540
You were here the whole time?

938
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:35.249
I'm here to tell you about the schedule for Operation
Yashima, which will commence at midnight tomorrow.

939
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:41.389
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami are to
report at Terminal 2 at 19:30.

940
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:46.439
At 20:00, Unit 01, accompanied
by Unit 00, will be transferred.

941
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.729
Launch is scheduled at 20:05.

942
01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:51.730
By 20:30, they will arrive at
the 2nd Futagoyama fortress.

943
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:55.039
After that, they will await further orders.

944
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.990
When the clock strikes midnight,
the operation will begin.

945
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.360
Your food.

946
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.040
I don't feel like eating anything.

947
01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:07.570
We leave in 90 minutes.

948
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.799
You're saying I'll be
piloting that thing again?

949
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.580
Yes.

950
01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:16.119
I don't want to. I don't want
to feel that scared anymore.

951
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.509
It's terrifying...! But I
can't even run away...

952
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:22.220
You're afraid of Eva?

953
01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:24.770
Then stay and rest.

954
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.390
Rest?

955
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.890
I will pilot Unit 01.

956
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
Ayanami!

957
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:35.450
Farewell.

958
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.339
The Angel is penetrating through
the 17th armoured plate!

959
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.209
Target will reach NERV Headquarters
in 4 minutes 55 seconds.

960
01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:01.719
The new western Hakone line and the southern
Tounosawa overhead line have been electrified.

961
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:06.239
Currently, the number 16 substation is continuing
to establish its transformer equipment.

962
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.480
500,000 volts are flowing through the transformers
as planned. No changes to the time sheet.

963
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.289
The 28th transformer group will
arrive after a five minute delay.

964
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:18.400
All related persons, please
hurry to your respective lines.

965
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:23.780
Begin proceeding to Stage Four of the simulation.
Now re-checking recovery and support systems.

966
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:30.250
All SMES have been set up. Sequential
start-up from the first bundle confirmed.

967
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:35.590
All mega-high voltage superconductor transformers'
opening and closing checks complete. No problems.

968
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.850
So this is the giant positron cannon?

969
01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.969
The assembly was rushed, but
theoretically it should work.

970
01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:55.139
We're zeroing the alignment on our end and getting
it ready to link with the G-type equipment.

971
01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.230
And, well, the rest is up to you.

972
01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.070
You mean up to the pilot.

973
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.280
Misato, I sure hope this works.

974
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:11.830
Shinji-kun, you were
supposed to report long ago.

975
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:18.000
You chose to stay here, didn't you?

976
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.130
Then do your job properly.

977
01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:25.710
I'm afraid of piloting the Eva...

978
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.640
You and the others have
nothing to be afraid of.

979
01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:33.069
You're always just giving orders
from your base underground.

980
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:35.600
I'm the only one experiencing
these terrifying things.

981
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.690
You all are hypocrites.

982
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:47.430
Come with me for a sec.

983
01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240
Fifteen years ago,

984
01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:00.580
half of humanity died in the Second Impact.

985
01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.549
If the Angels cause a Third Impact now,

986
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:07.800
humanity will die out. No one will survive.

987
01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.890
I've heard this story
countless times already.

988
01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.920
If an Angel ever reaches Level
EEE of NERV Headquarters...

989
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.790
an automatic self-destruct would commence.

990
01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:30.569
We will sacrifice ourselves to prevent
the Third Impact from happening.

991
01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:34.620
Everyone who works here understands
and accepts that risk.

992
01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:54.050
This is...

993
01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.900
It can't be... An Eva...!?

994
01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:05.329
Not quite. The bringer of life to this
planet, and the agent of its extinction...

995
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:08.629
The Second Angel, Lilith.

996
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:09.800
Lilith...?

997
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:13.640
Yes. Some believe it will act as
the trigger for the Third Impact.

998
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.539
We fight with the Evas to protect Lilith.

999
01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.710
That is something that only you can do.

1000
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:25.630
We're entrusting the future of
humanity to you and the Eva.

1001
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.050
And why give me that
painful responsibility?

1002
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:34.830
No reason. Fate chose you, that's all.

1003
01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:40.730
But you're not the only one putting
your life on the line here, Shinji-kun.

1004
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.610
We all are.

1005
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.200
I'll pilot it... one more time...

1006
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:08.679
I will now inform you of your
roles in this operation.

1007
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.680
Shinji-kun.

1008
01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.450
Yes?

1009
01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:12.619
You will act as gunner in Unit 01.

1010
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.620
Yes.

1011
01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:15.970
Rei, you and Unit 00 will be on defence.

1012
01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480
Yes.

1013
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:21.100
The operation this time
calls for utmost precision.

1014
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:27.650
That's why, instead of the uncalibrated Unit 00, we chose
to use Unit 01, even though it's still undergoing repairs.

1015
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:29.649
Listen, Shinji-kun.

1016
01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:35.679
Because of the Earth's rotation, magnetic field, and
gravity, the positron cannon won't fire straight.

1017
01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.120
Don't forget to take those
factors into account.

1018
01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:41.460
You must strike the core in a single shot.

1019
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.170
But I don't know where this one's core is.

1020
01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:49.550
Don't worry. There's a portion that
materializes during its attack phase.

1021
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.789
We believe that's where
its core is located.

1022
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:58.239
Your sniping position, as well as various factors that
affect your trajectory, will all be in putted by us.

1023
01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:04.080
Thus, all you have to do is to follow the on-screen
prompts, and fire when the center indicators meet.

1024
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.360
The machine will handle the rest.

1025
01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:13.990
However only one spot has been set
up to supply all of this power.

1026
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.700
For that reason, Unit 01 cannot
change its firing position.

1027
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:20.409
Retreating isn't an option, then?

1028
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:21.410
Correct.

1029
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:24.609
So what if I miss, and
the Angel shoots back?

1030
01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:29.630
Don't concern yourself with unnecessary thoughts
now. Focus on destroying the target in one shot.

1031
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.890
If I don't, we'll be in a big pinch, huh?

1032
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.209
I... I am supposed to protect Unit 01?

1033
01:20:37.210 --> 01:20:38.210
Yes.

1034
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.300
Understood.

1035
01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.110
It's time. Both of you, get dressed.

1036
01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.640
Yes.
Yes.

1037
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.240
You know...

1038
01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.410
we might die this time.

1039
01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800
No.

1040
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.910
You won't die.

1041
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:07.080
I will protect you.

1042
01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.880
I'm not worth protecting...

1055
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:47.510
You're strong, Ayanami.

1056
01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.480
I don't have anything else.

1057
01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.610
It's time. Let's go.

1058
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.500
Farewell.

1059
01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:14.420
Be aware that, as of now, it
has just passed midnight.

1060
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:19.829
It's time.

1061
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:25.140
Shinji-kun, you chose to pilot your Eva.
If only for that, I am grateful.

Proceeding with final calibration of
positron acceleration chamber. No problems.

1120
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:41.130
I'm not prepared for this like Ayanami is.

1121
01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.690
And I don't have the
confidence to handle my Eva.

1122
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:48.170
I just do what I'm told,
without any reason.

1123
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:50.720
Protect humanity...?

1124
01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.839
I didn't even realize I was
doing such a vital thing...

1125
01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.330
So why does it have to be me?

1126
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.149
13, 12, 11...

1127
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:05.150
10, 9, 8, 7...

1128
01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:11.200
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1129
01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320
Fire!

1130
01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.460
Did we get it?!

1131
01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:41.040
It missed?!

1132
01:27:41.041 --> 01:27:42.440
Impossible! Was it the timing?!

1133
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.230
High-order energy reading
detected from target!

1134
01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.940
All hands, brace for impact!

1135
01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.310
What's the status of the energy system?

1136
01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:25.749
It's still usable. We're
already recharging!

1137
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:27.189
And the positron cannon?

1138
01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:30.139
Still operational. Barrel
cooling now in progress.

1139
01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.839
But unable to verify if
another shot is possible.

1140
01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.329
No need to verify. Just do it.

1141
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:36.530
Shinji-kun, are you alright?!

1142
01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.600
Hurry and get Unit 01 back
into firing position!

1143
01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680
Shinji-kun?!

1144
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.580
Unit 01's pilot is hereby relieved of duty.

1145
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.810
We'll entrust the task of
sniping to Unit 00's pilot.

1146
01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:01.130
Ikari!

1147
01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:04.339
If he is of no use, we have
no choice but to cut him off.

1148
01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:05.730
Please hold on!

1149
01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.310
He didn't run from piloting the Eva.

1150
01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.900
He chose not to step down of his own
volition. We should entrust this to him!

1151
01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.389
Shinji, we're counting on you!

1152
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:18.280
Ikari, do your best!

1153
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:37.930
Please have some faith in your own son.

1154
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.060
I will place my faith in him as well.

1155
01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:54.059
I'll leave it to you. Do as you please.

1156
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.350
Thank you, sir!

1157
01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:57.460
Shinji-kun.

1158
01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.720
Yes...?

1159
01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.700
We're going to entrust you
with all of Japan's energy...

1160
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:05.649
With our future... All humanity's future...

1161
01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:08.040
The future of all living
things that have survived...

1162
01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:10.170
They're all in your hands.

1163
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:12.050
Try your hardest!

1164
01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:13.610
Yes!

1165
01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.139
Cannon locked into position.

1166
01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.559
Readjusting power discharge system.

1167
01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.470
Unit 01's G-type equipment has been purged.

1168
01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:23.890
Switching final firing
system to manual mode.

1169
01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:33.650
Enemy drill tip has breached
the ceiling directly above HQ!

1170
01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:34.980
Ready second shot!

1171
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:39.320
Replacing fuse! Barrel cooling complete!

1172
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:42.049
Power supply system is
operating at full capacity.

1173
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:44.449
Ground crew evacuation complete.

1174
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:46.329
No problems with any of
the discharge plugs.

1175
01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:48.809
Final sniping specifications
data entry complete.

1176
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:51.919
Any further adjustments will have
to be done manually, by the pilot!

1177
01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.330
We'll reach discharge pressure in 0.2!

1178
01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:57.670
High-order energy readings
from target again!

1179
01:30:57.970 --> 01:30:58.970
Crap!

1180
01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.280
Shinji-kun!

1181
01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.420
Ayanami!

1182
01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.670
The shield won't hold!

1183
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:28.410
How much longer?!

1184
01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.540
Only 20 seconds!

1185
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:31.290
Hurry...

1186
01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.090
Come on... Come on!

1187
01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120
Come on!

1188
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.990
We did it!

1189
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:49.730
Ayanami!

1190
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:55.980
Ayanami!

1191
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.870
Ayanami!

1192
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:30.810
Are you okay?!

1193
01:33:30.811 --> 01:33:32.330
Ayanami?! Ayanami!

1194
01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:47.550
Don't say things like,
"I have nothing else".

1195
01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:54.860
Don't say sad things like "farewell,"
as if we'll never meet again...

1196
01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:06.030
Why are you crying?

1197
01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.370
I'm sorry.

1198
01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:14.330
I don't know what kind of expression
I should have at a time like this...

1199
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:17.710
It'd be best if you smiled, I think.

1200
01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:02.040
Let me guess... The boy has awakened. Now we
enter the general phase of the plan, yes?

1201
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:07.760
That's correct. The Dead Sea Scroll Apocrypha
have been fulfilled up to the Books of law.

1202
01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.550
The promised time draws near.

1203
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:16.699
Not the Third again...

1204
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.520
You never change, do you?

1205
01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:23.610
I look forward to meeting
you, Ikari Shinji-kun.

1206
01:35:23.650 --> 01:35:26.360
TO BE CONTINUED

1207
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:37.130
It's only love

1208
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.230
It's only love

1209
01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:51.140
If I can be granted just one wish,

1210
01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:59.460
then let me sleep by your
side, wherever that may be.

1211
01:35:59.850 --> 01:36:02.869
Beautiful world

1212
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:08.100
Without regrets, my eyes are only on you.

1213
01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.040
Beautiful boy

1214
01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:19.050
You don't know yet, just
how beautiful you are.

1215
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.490
It's only love

1216
01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:30.650
Whether you're sleeping or awake,

1217
01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:38.810
You just dream of shounen manga, silly.
Don't you like yourself?

1218
01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:47.450
You don't know what you want,
but you can't stop wanting.

1219
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:55.570
Lukewarm tears roll down your cheeks.

1220
01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:00.290
I have nothing I want to tell you,

1221
01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.250
I just want to meet you again.

1222
01:37:06.490 --> 01:37:08.420
I can't say what I want to tell you,

1223
01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:12.590
Maybe I'm just a coward.

1224
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.979
But that's all right too.

1225
01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:22.980
If I can be granted just one wish,

1226
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:31.270
Please let me sleep next to you.
Wherever that may be.

1227
01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.659
Beautiful world

1228
01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:39.969
Without regrets, my eyes are only on you.

1229
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:42.870
Beautiful boy

1230
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:50.160
You don't know yet, just
how beautiful you are.

1231
01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:54.360
It's only love

1232
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:02.699
No matter what it is,
give everything a try.

1233
01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:10.700
Even if you get hurt, it's
a valuable experience.

1234
01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.350
I don't see the need for newspapers,

1235
01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:18.380
The important things are not printed there.

1236
01:38:21.650 --> 01:38:23.570
How are you doing recently?

1237
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.680
So long as you are well,

1238
01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:30.089
I'll be fine.

1239
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:38.090
If I can't meet you before my world ends,

1240
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:46.450
Please let me sleep next to you.
Wherever that may be.

1241
01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.799
Beautiful world

1242
01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:55.079
As these fleeting days pass by,

1243
01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.140
Beautiful boy

1244
01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:03.150
It's natural to feel whimsical.

1245
01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:11.460
If I can be granted just one wish,

1246
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:18.880
Please let me sleep next to you.

1247
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:40.020
Beautiful world

1248
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:48.080
Beautiful boy

1249
01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.560
Beautiful world

1250
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:04.800
Beautiful boy

1251
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:13.260
Beautiful world

1252
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:27.620
PREVIEW

1253
01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:29.619
Backup Eva 05 is sortied into action.

1254
01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.790
Unit 02 and its pilot are
moved to the front lines.

1255
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:33.750
Unit 04 mysteriously goes missing.

1256
01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.500
The disaster that took place when
Unit 03 was forcefully activated.

1257
01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.260
And finally, Unit 06 and its
pilot descend from the moon!

1258
01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.010
As Ikari Shinji continues to mentally
deteriorate, where will our story lead?

1259
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:50.170
Next time in Rebuild of
Evangelion 2.0: Division

1260
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:53.990
And we'll have lots of
fan service for you next time, too!
